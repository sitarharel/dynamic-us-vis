# Dynamic US Data Visualization

#### A playful integration of several data visualization techniques to show and compare data about the US

This project was a collaboration between Akekawit Jitprasert, Kate Peng, and Sitar Harel for Cornell's CS 3300. 

__The project is hosted [here](http://sitarharel.com/states).__

### Method Explanation

The driving engine behind the visualization is the bubblemap object - a unique, force driven map built by the team that provides an API for beautiful and smooth motion and data visualization. Using the API, we can define interpolations for each of the state objects that occur concurrently, giving the user the feeling that the whole map is flowing from one visualization to the next.
